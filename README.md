## Understanding Interaction Terms in Regression: A Practical Example

#### Overview
In regression modeling, interaction terms are used to capture the combined effect of two or more variables on the target variable. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the relationship between the variables and the target variable is not simply additive. In this example, we explore the concept of interaction terms using a practical example: predicting the time spent by users on an ecommerce platform based on their activity.

#### Example: User Activity and Time Spent
Let's first generated a synthetic dataset to simulate user activity on an ecommerce platform. The dataset includes:
- ``added_in_cart`` : Whether a user added items to cart or not (1 for adding to cart or 0 for not adding to cart).
- ```purchased``` : Whether a user made a purchase or not (1 for making a purchase or 0 for not making a purchase).
- ```time_spent``` : The total time a user spent on an ecommerce platfotm (continuous). We are trying to predict this feature, i.e, how long a user will spend on an ecommerce platform based on whether they add items to cart and making a purchase.

Below we can start by examining the relationship between these two features and time spent.

- As indicated by the boxplots above, both adding items to the cart and making a purchase are associated with significantly higher time spent on the platform.
- The median time spent by users who engaged in these actions is roughly double that of users who did not engage in these actions.
