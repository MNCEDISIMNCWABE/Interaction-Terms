## Understanding Interaction Terms in Regression: A Practical Example

#### Overview
In regression modeling, interaction terms are used to capture the combined effect of two or more variables on the target variable. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the relationship between the variables and the target variable is not simply additive. In this example, we explore the concept of interaction terms using a practical example: predicting the time spent by users on an ecommerce platform based on their activity.

#### Example: User Activity and Time Spent
Let's first generated a synthetic dataset to simulate user activity on an ecommerce platform. The dataset includes:
- ``added_in_cart``: Whether the user added items to cart (1 for adding to cart 0r 0 for not adding to cart).
- ```purchased```: Whether the user made a purchase or now (1 for making a purchase or 0 for not making a purchase).
- ```time_spent```: The total time the user spent on the website (continuous). We are trying to predict this, i.e, how long a user will spend on the ecommerce platform based on whether they add items to cart and making a purchase.
